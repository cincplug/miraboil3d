## Miraboil3d

Idea behind this 3d component library is to bring together [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Mirabeau frontend boilerplate](https://github.com/mirabeau-nl/frontend-boilerplate), combining power of the first with simplicity and modularity of the second.

More info on the original boilerplate in it's [own README](README-boilerplate.md)

Feel free to fork and suggest improvements! Sorry for current lack of documentation, it's not how I usually do things :)
